# Pogo #
#### An add-on module for ISP programming without header pins ####

This is primarily for use in programming microcontrollers on projects that mainly use Surface Mount parts. Having header pins present may be inconvenient, or may prevent the PCB from fitting withing a particular enclosure. Pogo allows you to use the ISP pads, without installing the header pins.
